        <p><em>Aspiring Web Developer</em><br></p>
        <p>
          I graduated from college in 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Finance and
          Economics. I worked for a year in a CTA, and I had to learn how to use a
          software that used coding in it. The software used Python. Ever since then,
          I have been curious about learning programming. Now, I finally took that
          step and am learning how to be a web developer.
